<h1>Purpose</h1>

This project is for a class, matrix methods in machine learning, and will teach people working with the project and following a curriculum how to understand and use genetic functions.

Our main takeaway points will be:
-What problem a genetic algorithm solves
-What a genetic algorithm means
-Pros and cons of using genetic algorithms
-How to implement the ideas of neuroevolution in a more a complex structure, such as a neural net.
